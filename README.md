# notifybymailurlchanged
Send mail notification when a URL changes
This script uses the mail() function to send an email to the specified email address whenever the contents of the URL change. You can customize the email settings based on your specific requirements, such as the recipient email address, subject, and message. Note that you may need to configure your server's email settings to enable sending email from PHP.
